# ID Learns Git

Welcome to the Git training sandbox!

Fire up [Tower](http://www.git-tower.com/), [connect your Github account](http://www.git-tower.com/help/mac/manage-hosting-services/connect-accounts), and get ready to __learn__.

The following excercises will be done during the training session.

## Exercise #1 - Introduce yourself

1. **Clone** this repository to your computer using Tower
2. **Add** a folder named after your BU login
3. **Add** a `README.md` file to your directory
4. **Stage** your changes for commit
5. **Commit** with a thoughtful message

## Excercise #2 - Sharing is Caring

1. **Push** your commit to the remote **origin** (Github)
2. Wait for someone else to do the same, and **fetch** their changes in to your local repository
3. Take a look at their changes, and then **pull** them into your **master** branch

## Excercise #3 - Embrace the stash

1. Make a change to your `README.md`, but don't commit it
2. Meanwhile, someone else should update their `README.md` with a super important change, commit and push to origin
3. **Stash** your local changes so that you can get theirs...
4. Pull down their urgent change
5. ...and **apply** your stash to restore your work
