The code was written a year earlier but you've been asked to restyle this header differently. What are some ways we can drastically improve the following css delaration.

<div class="card">
  <h2 class="unique-title">Unique title header</h2>
</div>

.card > h2 {
	border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;
	font-size: 26px;
	margin-bottom: 8px;
	padding-bottom: 8px;
}

.kill-border {
	border-bottom: 0px;
	padding-bottom: 0px;
}
